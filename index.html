<h2><a id="about-adazzle" class="anchor" href="#about-adazzle" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Adazzle</h2>
<p>You might not know us, but you’ll know plenty of people who can’t do without us. Media agencies, advertisers and publishers use our platform to do their business and we’re uniting the tangle of technologies, APIs, and people that make up the Ad-Tech industry.</p>
<p>We’re small right now, but doing big things - processing over £1bn of media a year across Europe and SE Asia - with big ambitions to grow rapidly. We’re 14 years strong but we know that we’re only at the beginning. You couldn’t pick a better time to join our journey.</p>
<p>We’re a friendly bunch who love to socialize, get passionate about coffee, fight over food and drink, and look after ourselves and each other.</p>
<p>Come and join the Adazzle family</p>

<h2><a id="open-roles" class="anchor" href="#open-roles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Roles</h2>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://adazzle.workable.com/">adazzle.workable.com</a> to see the open roles.</p>
<p>They range right from Junior through to Senior Leads, and while we consider all candidates who apply equally, any experience working in Digital Advertising or the wider Media industry is a big plus.</p>

<a id="react-data-grid" class="anchor" href="#react-data-grid" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>React Data Grid</h2>

<p>We think <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">react</a> <a href="http://react.rocks">rocks</a> and use it a whole load at Adazzle.
<a href="http://adazzle.github.io/react-data-grid">React Data Grid</a> is a Excel-like grid component built with React, with editors, keyboard navigation, copy &amp; paste, and the like. It's simple to get going with, but pretty powerful. And designed to be lightening fast even when used for large data sets with complex editing. </p>

<h2><a id="win-an-interview" class="anchor" href="#win-an-interview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Win An Interview</h2>
<p>Right now, we're running a competiton where you can win an interview to join our team.</p>
<p>If you're interested in taking part, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/adazzle/react-data-grid/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASMR">React Data Grid GitHub page.</a></p>
<p>We've got five challenges of varying difficulty. If you can code any one of them and get a Pull Request merged by Friday 20th October, we'll guarantee you an interview for one of our open Dev roles.</p>
<p>We'll be looking for quality, not quantity -- though you should include tests if you can.</p>
<p>Get started by cloning React Data Grid and running gulp in the directory root. Our editor of choice is Atom but you are of course free to use whatever you prefer.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
